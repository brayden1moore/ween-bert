Thank you[split]My dinner's on fire while she watches TV
And if you've ever wondered what it's like to be me
She takes all my money and leaves me no smokes
Yells at my buddies and insults my folks[split]I'm breakin' my back, doin' the best that I can
She's got time for the dog and none for her man
And I'm no dope, but I can't cope
So hit the fuckin' road and piss up a rope[split]You can piss up a rope and you can put on your shoes
Hit the road, get truckin', pack your bag, I don't need the ag
On your knees you big, booty bitch start suckin'[split]You ride my ass like a horse in a saddle
Now you're up shits creek with a turd for a paddle
And I can't cope, piss up a rope[split]Uh, you can piss up a rope and feel the pissy dribble
You can piss up a rope and watch me giggle
For the last six months, I been packin' your bag
You can wash my balls with a warm, wet rag[split]Till my balls feel smooth and soft like silk
I'm sick of your mouth and your two percent milk
And I'm no dope, but I've lost all hope
So hit the fuckin' road and piss up a rope[split]You can piss up a rope and you can put on your shoes
Hit the road, get truckin', pack your bag, I don't need the ag
On your knees you big, booty bitch start suckin'[split]You ride my ass like a horse in a saddle

And I can't cope, piss up a rope[split]You can piss up a rope and you can put on your shoes

Now you're up shits creek with a turd for a paddle
And I can't cope, piss up a rope[split]It's been a while since I've seen you smile
But now you've come back again
Came into the room and you saw my girl
And you asked her, "How long it's been?"[split]"A year" she said
And you shook your head
Said "I'm surprised it's gone on that long"[split]Baby, baby, baby bitch
For words I am at a loss
Baby, baby, baby bitch
I'm better now, please fuck off[split]What else you gonna say when
While you're back on your stay
Maybe something, maybe nothing, we'll see
It's just too bad, you're beautiful I guess
I wasn't for you and you weren't for me[split]Baby, baby, baby bitch
Please slip back into yourself
Baby, baby, baby bitch
Go conquer someone else[split]People say, "How beautiful, how sweet, how kind"
You're perfect, you've got nothing to hide
But I, for one, have seen the sun
And the bitch that you've locked up inside[split]Got fat, got angry, started hating myself
Wrote, "Birthday boy" for you babe
Now I'm skinny and sick and paranoid
Without a cent to my name[split]Baby, baby, baby bitch
Fuck you, you stinkin' ass ho
Most beauty I've seen, you come from a dream
But I can't close my eyes anymore
No, I can't close my eyes anymore
I can't close my eyes anymore[split]Hey little boy, what you got there?
Kind sir, it's a mollusk I've found
Did you find it in the sandy ground?
Does it emulate the ocean's sound?[split]Yes I found it on the ground
Emulating the ocean's sound
Bring forth the mollusk cast unto me
Let's be forever, let forever be free[split]Hey little boy come walk with me
And bring your new found mollusk along
Does it speaketh of the Trinity?
Can it gaze at the sun with its wandering eye?[split]Yes it speaks of the Trinity
Casting light at the sun with it's wandering eye
Bring forth the mollusk cast unto me
Let's be forever, let forever be free[split]You see there are three things that spur the mollusk from the sand
The waking of all creatures that live on the land
And with just one faint glance back into the sea
The mollusk lingers with it's wandering eye[split]AIDS

I said it was you that had killed him
And that I'd find you and up stand the law[split]The people of the village believed me
Mama, she wanted revenge
I told her that I'd see that she was honored
I'd find you and put you to death[split]So now, now that I've found you

I tell you it was me who killed him
But the truth I'll never have to say[split]Buenas tardes amigo

And you're racing towards the line[split]Slow down boy, he's breaking your heart
His innocence will tear you apart
His love is young, you don't have to hurry
You've got all the time in the world[split]I've watched you from the back seat
Crying as you walked away
I see beauty in the future
Lay back and let him blow you away, yeah[split]When you're dancing with disaster
And living on the edge
Let the moment be your master
Don't get so far ahead[split]Slow down boy, he's breaking your heart
His innocence will tear you apart
His love is young, you don't have to hurry
You've got all the time in the world[split]Slow down boy, slow down
Let him show you
Let him blow you away, away, yeah[split]Buenas tardes amigo
Hola, my good friend
Cinco de Mayo's on Tuesday
And I hoped we'd see each other again[split]You killed my brother last winter
You shot him three times in the back
In the night I still hear mama weeping
Oh, mama still dresses in black[split]I looked at every fiesta
For you I wanted to greet
Maybe I'd sell you a chicken
With poison interlaced with the meat[split]You, you look like my brother
Mama loved him the best
He was head honcho with the ladies
Mama always said he was blessed[split]The village all gathered around him
They couldn't believe what they saw
I said it was you that had killed him
And that I'd find you and upstand the law[split]The people of the village believed me
Mama, she wanted revenge
I told her I'd see that she was honored
I'd find you and put you to death[split]So now, now that I've found you
On this such a joyous day
I tell you it was me who killed him
But the truth I'll never have to say[split]Buenas tardes amigo
Hola, my good friend

A Tear For Eddie
(Instrumental)[split]Is it alive? Does it writhe?
Can it survive under the sun?[split]I can't put my finger on it[split]Is it green? Is it red?
Is it alive or is it dead?[split]I can't put my finger on it[split]Scathe with a lathe
All the days in the past[split]I can't put my finger on it[split]Is it brown? Is it white?
Is it really out of sight?[split]I can't put my finger on it[split]Can it squeal, does it squirm?
If it's fresh, will it burn?[split]I can't put my finger on it[split]Can it fly? Will it try
If the wings are still wet?[split]I can't put my finger on it[split]Can it heal? Is it real?
Can it feel the threads of time?[split]I can't put my finger on it[split]Does it glow, will it shine?
Does it leave a trail of slime?[split]I can't put my finger on it[split]I said, "Are you surprised when I touch the dwarf inside?"
I said, "Are you surprised when I touch the dwarf inside?"[split]Are you surprised when I touch the dwarf inside?
Are you surprised when I touch the dwarf inside?[split]Is it alive, does it writhe?
Can it survive under the sun?[split]I can't put my finger on it[split]Is it green? Is it red?
Is it alive or is it dead?[split]I can't put my finger on it[split]Scathe with a lathe
All the days in the past[split]I can't put my finger on it[split]Is it brown? Is it white?
Is it really out of sight?[split]I can't put my finger on it[split]Transdermal celebration caused a slight mutation in the rift
It's awful domination left the people running for the hills
But the mutants that I see shine their beauty unto me
I wish you could see them[split]Tectonic tribulation formed a crust of green beyond the reef
Waves fell in formation 'cause the plants to bend
With spiked leaves, I'm growing with the land
Time has taken my hands and let me touch them[split]Hey, hey, a billion miles to Mark A
Lay on the lawn, he's already home
When the morning ray hits his face[split]Transdermal celebration, jets flew in formation
I could see them, dropping the crustaceans
Leaving trails of flames in their wake but where
Is the mutation who once told me it was safe? I can't find him[split]How would you feel if I took you away
To a place I know, a place where we could stay
Called Joppa Road, a pretty place I know
Where we can go called Joppa Road[split]The things I feel on Joppa Road
Can make me stay and make me go
This old road where I long to go
Called Joppa Road where we can go[split]Put your best dress on, there's a place I know
Where we can go called Joppa Road
It's a little ways where the sun shines down
Where we drive real slow on Joppa Road
Joppa Road, a pretty place I know
Where we can go called Joppa Road[split]Hey, yo bro, that's a dude I know
Works on Joppa Road at the Sunoco
If we drive by slow, with the top down low
We'll heel and toe on Joppa Road[split]How would you feel if I took you away
To a place I know, a place where we could stay
Called Joppa Road, a pretty place I know
Where we can go called Joppa Road[split]It's a little ways where the sun shines down
Where we drive real slow on Joppa Road
On Joppa Road, Joppa Road[split]Baby, you look great today[split]How would you feel if I took you away
To a place I know, a place where we could stay
Called Joppa Road, a pretty place I know
Where we can go called Joppa Road[split]A child without an eye
Made her mother cry, why ask why?
She kept her child clean
On Buckingham Green[split]The children saw the eye
As a sign from God
Descending from the sky
It was alright to dream
Of Buckingham Green[split]Summon the queen
Spoke the child of eye it's time to fly
Turning fire to steam
On Buckingham Green[split]A child without an eye
Made her mother cry, why ask why?
She kept her child clean
On Buckingham Green[split]Jesus Christ
Pain
Take one
Yeah, pain[split]Last time I saw you, I was holding your hand
And I couldn't wait for you to leave
I knew right then that it was over and done
And I couldn't believe that I was free[split]Help me now, I'm going down
And I don't know if I'll be okay
I'll be around, I'll be in town
If you need a place to stay[split]When the wind blows and there's a chill in the air
I hope that someone is taking care of you
I'm alright, yeah, I'm really okay
Just so you know, I'm always there for you[split]Help me now, I'm going down
And I don't know if I'll be okay
I'll be around, I'll be in town
If you need a place to stay[split]{[Incomprehensible]}[split]{Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you
Happy birthday dear Aaron, happy birthday to you
[Incomprehensible]
You're no longer only just a teenager, you're a full-grown 20
[Incomprehensible]}[split]And when the sun it turns to snow
And the grass doesn't grow, don't laugh I love you
I could look outside my window every day
But you wouldn't be there to come out and play, don't laugh I love you[split]Ernest hemming way would always be there for me
But now earnest hemming way is dead now
If I could get you back someday
Don't you say you're going away, don't laugh I love you[split]And if you locked me in the sun
To the tinkle I would run, don't laugh I love you[split]I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you
Don't laugh I love you[split]I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you[split]Ahhhhh, shit, ahhh
Ahhhh bumblebee stung me
He stung my brain
Awwwww
He stung me, he stung me, uhh[split]Weedeating Vaughn's grass
A big bumblebee came right out
He stung me 47,000 times on my head
It hurt, it hurt, oh god it hurt so badly[split]Ahhhh bumblebee stung me
Bumblebee stung me
Bumblebee stung me
Bumblebee stung me
Thank you[split]In the morning sun, I couldn't tell you
I couldn't tell you so many things
About how much I really love you
About how much you really mean[split]So far away but it's so easy to see you
When I'm away I want to put my arms around you
And I want to know do you feel the same way?
'Cause if you do I want to stay forever[split]And I want to know do you feel the same way?
'Cause if you do I want to stay forever
With you[split]So many colors that surround you
Some so bright, I can hardly see
A light reflects on all the things that make you real
Things that make you truly free[split]So far away but it's so easy to see you
When I'm away I want to put my arms around you
And I want to know do you feel the same way?
'Cause if you do I want to stay forever[split]And I want to know do you feel the same way?
'Cause if you do I want to stay forever
With you[split]Do you ever walk alone?
Like a drifter in the dark
Seeking out what isn't there
Looking only for a spark[split]From a girl who's all alone
Maybe she's a driftin' too
Like a shadow in the night
Waitin' just to meet with you[split]And then perhaps in love you'll stay
Or fall and go your seperate ways
Still searchin' for a spark
Like a drifter in the dark[split]Do you ever walk alone?
Like a drifter in the dark
Seeking out what isn't there
Looking only for a spark[split]Like a drifter in the dark
Like a drifter in the dark
Like a drifter in the dark
...[split]Like a Japanese cowboy or a brother on skates
Like a blizzard in Georgia or a train runnin' late
I call out your name girl in the heat of the night
And nobody answers 'cause somethin' ain't right[split]Breakfast at Shoney's at 2.99
Saved me some money and eased up my mind
I'm walkin' in circles and feelin' the pain
I'm tossin' and turnin' and cryin' in vain[split]Like a Japanese cowboy or a brother on skates
Like a blizzard in Georgia or a train runnin' late
I call out your name girl in the heat of the night
And nobody answers 'cause somethin' ain't right[split]Here we go[split]I'm ridin' at midnight and crossin' the line
From the rain in my windshield and the tears in my eyes
Now the bedroom is empty and I spent my last dime
And the lovers are leavin', I got nothin' but time
I got you on my mind[split]Like a Japanese cowboy or a brother on skates
Like a blizzard in Georgia or a train runnin' late
I call out your name girl in the heat of the night
And nobody answers 'cause somethin' ain't right[split]Let me lock you in the system at Warp 2
Push it on into systematic overdrive
You know what to do[split]Let's cruise past all the golden poo
That makes me blue
These things gonna help you do better[split]Poop, poop
Poop ship, poop ship, ship destroyer
On the poop ship, poop ship, ship destroyer[split]Let me jam all the frequencies on channel 2
I was been chewin' on this brownie
An' I think, I'm almost through[split]Let's cruise, the chocolate stew was you know for you
I told you to jam this frequency
This sector's chartered by you[split]Everybody
Poop ship, on the poop ship, ship destroyer

Help me find my way home watching the eel
Burrows its head in the sand, daylight has come
There shall be rest in a while, daylight has come[split]I can not repeal the words of the golden eel[split]Who can explain all these thoughts racking my mind
An endless barrage of shit racking my mind
The eel offered his sound I can't understand
Speaking it's truth from the bank now I can see[split]I can not repeal the words of the golden eel
I can not repeal the words of the golden eel[split]I can not repeal the words of the golden eel
I can not reveal the words of the golden eel[split]I can not repeal the words of the golden eel

With the writing of Kafka in hand and a bunny in a can
Slipping and sliding you feel yourself asking her
Why would you want me to try?[split]Squeezing your wrist and she's pulling you closer
Down where the devils are dying with laughter
Then led to a place where there's no form of pleasure
She blows you a kiss from her lips[split]She's your baby
She's your baby
She's your baby[split]Those below us can not be renounced 'cause they're talking
And for once I wish they'd shut up their mouths
Lock their doors and stay in the house and while you're inside there
You might want to question the fact that you're not quite the same[split]And look to the room where she's keeping so quiet
A million layers of crust and deposit
Blanket the seasons and bury the reasons
You told her that this was for good[split]She's your baby
She's your baby
She's your baby[split]Mister, would you please help my pony?
He's over there behind the tree
He's down in the dirt, would you help him?
I think it's his lung[split]Mister would you please help my pony?
He's chewin' bark and not the leaves
He's cryin' like a baby, would you help him?
I think it's his lung[split]Mister, would you please help my pony?
He's down and he ain't gettin' up
He coughed up snot in the driveway
And I think his lung's fucked up[split]Pony, pony, pony[split]Mister, would you please help my pony?
I think it's his lung[split]Mister, would you please help my pony?
He's over there lookin' at me
He can't talk because he's a pony
I think it's his lung[split]Mister, would you please help my pony?
He's over there behind the tree
He's down in the dirt, would you help him?
I think it's his lung[split]As she bounces through the blue sky
Everybody's building up a big blue balloon
They made the string from fairy wings and golden dreams
See how high it goes, no one knows about the blue balloon[split]She's defied the eyes of all man
Sliding over and down the big blue balloon
Can the father's love reach the child above the clouds?
So as to dance the day up high, way up high above the blue balloon
Blue, blue balloon, my soul calls to you[split]See her bounce along the banks of Buckinow
She's a sweet surprise and odd why accepting all
Beating along the paths, boulder caps and icicles
She melts into the earth and blows the air back to the central
Blue balloon, blue, blue balloon, my soul calls to you[split]Blue balloon, blue balloon, blue balloon
Blue balloon, blue balloon, blue balloon
Blue balloon, blue balloon, blue balloon, blue balloon
Blue, blue balloon, my soul calls to you[split]We gotta be tight, y'know
Ok, here it goes

Cold blows the drops of rain
I never had but one true love
And in Cam Ville he was slain[split]I'll do as much for my true love
As any young girl may
I'll sit and weep down by his grave
For twelve month and one day[split]But when twelve months were come and gone
This young man he arose
What makes you weep down by my grave
I can't take my repose?[split]One kiss, one kiss of your lily white lips
One kiss is all I crave
One kiss, one kiss of your lily white lips
And return back to your grave[split]My lips they are as cold as my clay
My breath is heavy and strong
If thou was to kiss my lily white lips
Thy days would not be long[split]Oh, don't you remember the garden grove
Where we used to walk?
Pluck the finest flower of them all
Twill wither to a stalk[split]Go fetch me a nun from the dungeon deep
And water from a stone
And white milk from a maiden's breast
That babe were never known[split]Go dig me a grave both long, wide and deep
As quickly as you may
I'll lie down in it and take one sleep
For twelve month and one day[split]Cold blows the wind over my true love
Cold blows the drops of rain
I never had but one true love
And in Cam Ville he was slain[split]I'll do as much for my true love
As any young girl may
I'll sit and weep down by his grave
For twelve month and one day[split]Did you ever see a whale with a polka dot tail
Did you ever seen a man with eight fingers on his hand
Did you have to dry your eye when you saw that puppy fly
Oh no, tell me it ain't so[split]Have you ever tried to shrink like a ice cube in the sink
Have you ever tried to see what lies hidden in the tree
Have you ever made a flan and squished it in your hand
Oh no, tell me it ain't so[split]Billy[split]Have you ever tried to shrink like a ice cube in the sink
Have you ever tried to see what lies hidden in the tree
Have you ever made a flan and squished it in your hand

Oh, silly girl, I'm so in love with you
Won't you tell me what's on your mind
If you'd open your head tell me what would I find
Are you for real? What do you feel?[split]Finders keepers, losers weepers, baby
If I could get the lid off, I'd look into the jar

I'll bet is creeping into your lonely room
The bed's on fire, your fate is sealed
And you're so tired, and the reason is Camille-mille
Shockadelica
The girl must be a witch
She's got your mind, body, and soul hitched
Shockadelica
You need a second opinion
But she never wears a stitch
So you can't take her home, she's got you tied with a golden rope
She won't let you play your guitar
And when you've cried enough
Maybe she'll let you up
For a nasty ride in her Shockadeli-car
Gonna make you beg[split]Gonna make you beg
Gonna make you spread your leg
Gonna want it, gonna get it
And you'll never regret it[split]Talk to me lover, come on tell me what you taste
Didn't your mama tell you life is to good to waste?
Didn't she tell you that Lovesexy was the glam of them all?
If you can hang, you can trip on it
You surely won't fall
No side effects and the feeling last forever
Straight up - it tastes good
It makes you feel clever
You kiss your enemies like you know you should
Then you jerk your body like a horny pony would
You jerk your body like a horny pony would
Now run and tell your mama about that[split]Let me lick your pussy, let me lick your cunt

A peak that you can't see?
I tell ya it's an easy thing
When it's you and me
But don't shit where you eat, my friend[split]A little food and drink uh huh
Nothin' too fancy
Lamb, veal, and some good old wine
This is the life for me
But don't shit where you eat, my friend[split]Dood dood doo doo doo doo
Dood dood doo doo doo doo
Dood dood doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Don't shit where you eat, my friend[split]I don't know who you are
Don't know who you want to be
When I carbonate the test tube
Then you won't see me[split]I got a twin cab diesel combo
It takes me where I want to go
And all the nuphies are happy
They know of a fungus that grow[split]So when you see Hoecke's mind screw
Don't come running to me
'Cause [Incomprehensible] will scream and set aflame
Marble tulip juicy tree[split]Marble tulip juicy tree
It's where I want to be
When I gnaw on the tulip
It'll wish that it was me[split]Every morning I put my shoes on
And I think about she
Who controls the four seasons
Inhaling kitties in the sea[split]It's like a noodle in a salad
Little birdy wants to be set free
I drill the corpse lobe with my mommy
Marble tulip juicy tree[split]So this song's about the loving things
That you are to me
Just stay away from my adenoids
And marble tulip juicy tree[split]Marble tulip juicy tree
It's where I want to be
When I gnaw on the tulip
It'll wish that it was me[split]It could rain for a 1000 days
Or something I dont know
Look to the sun and we're having fun
Besides the river flow
You are doing this and your doing that
Working all the time
Tonite you'll call me on the phone
Youve got a worried mind
And when you leave you'll go away
Gone to stay
Dont feel so bad
It was nice what we had
And you'll be glad
Ill miss you
Theres a moon and its bright tonite
The summers gone away
Stop the sweat and Ill feel alright
You know its I like it this way
Your packing stuff for your big big move
In just a couple of days
Youll be off on your big big cruise
Across the U.S.A

I'll try to keep in line
When I'm dancin' in the show tonight[split]Does my shuffle step
Really look so good?
Am I doin' it the way you think I should?[split]Would it be a miss
If I blew a kiss
When I'm dancin' in the show tonight?[split]Showtime now is getting nearer
And I'm getting scared
Wish I could see in the mirror
If I'm all prepared[split]First you take a step
Then you point your toe
Hope I know it like I did a week ago[split]Am I standing straight?
I can hardly wait
Till I'm dancing in the show tonight[split]Showtime now is getting nearer
And I'm getting scared
Wish I could see in the mirror
If I'm all prepared[split]First you take a step
Then you point your toe
Hope I know it like I did a week ago[split]Am I standing straight?
I can hardly wait
Till I'm dancing in the show tonight[split]Sometimes the ones you hold so close can make you cry
But it's a pain in the ass to let 'em go, oh
With a battered wish you hoped that the monkey wore a tie
But it's no surprise to find he don't[split]Put the pointed pencil in the pepper-po
And take a little sniff of the things below
Bring it to a boil and simmer low
Put the noodle on the griddle as it climbs the Grobe[split]Watch the worker shield his heart from the world outside
Didn't get a chance to let him know, oh
Alsace is spinning fast and wine mixed with the tide
Please don't let my brain explode, oh[split]Put the pointed pencil in the pepper-po
And take a little sniff of the things below
Bring it to a boil and simmer low
Put the noodle on the griddle as it climbs the Grobe[split]Sancho brought a message from the fat man
Sorry boy, to leave you high and dry
But I went to see my mom in Ensenada
And I left a little something to help the time go by
Just a little something to help to keep you high[split]Bananas and blow, bananas and blow
Stuck in my cabana, living on bananas and blow[split]Now the rainy season reminds me of Maria
The way she danced, the color of her hair
Now I'm locked inside a stall in the cantina
Eating the bananas and cocaine off the mirror
Looking for a ticket to take me away from here[split]Bananas and blow, bananas and blow
Stuck in my cabana, living on bananas and blow
Bananas and blow, bananas and blow
Stuck in my cabana, living on bananas and blow[split]Bananas and blow, bananas and blow
Stuck in my cabana, living on bananas and blow
Bananas and blow, oh bananas and blow
I'm stuck in my cabana, living on bananas and blow[split]You fucked up by Ween
You fucked up, you bitch

You sloppy little shit
Bitch, ah[split]Well, you dicked me over
But now you'll pay[split]You fucked up, ah
Well, you dicked me over
But now you'll pay
You fucked up, ah[split]Once there was one
Once there was only one
A foot, a hand, a tongue
Talking to no one and no one made nothing[split]To ease the balance it split in two
The older line became creation
And we saw bodies forming
From rib and from monkey[split]Half became the whole
A race of man and woman[split]Woman and man
Woman and man working together
I can show you, teach you something
If you listen, man and woman
Woman and man working together[split]Ocean and land
Ocean is land covered with water
I can tell you in my answer
If you listen, man and woman
Ocean is land covered with water[split]Killing for life
Life is a fight, let's fight it together
I can teach you, teach you something
If you listen, man and woman
Life is a fight, let's fight it together[split]Don't quiver little boy, your daddy's with you now
It won't be long anyhow
It's just around the corner
The destiny that I embrace with you[split]Oh, don't get too close to my fantasy
Don't be afraid to clutch the hand of your creator
Stare into the lion's eyes and if you taste the candy
You'll get to the surprise[split]Stay calm little dreamer and drift off into dreams
The gentle kiss of night is better than it seems
It's just around the corner
Close your eyes and soon you'll be with me[split]Oh, don't get too close to my fantasy
Don't be afraid to clutch the hand of your creator
Stare into the lion's eyes and if you taste the candy
You'll get to the surprise, oh[split]Don't get too close to my fantasy
Don't be afraid to clutch the hand of your creator
Stare into the lion's eyes and if you taste the candy
You'll get to the surprise[split]Oh, don't get too close to my fantasy
Don't be afraid to clutch the hand of your creator
Stare into the lion's eyes and if you taste the candy
You'll get to the surprise, oh[split]I'm goin' crazy, trying to keep you sane
Taking my prescriptions and forging my name
I was happy this morning, you finally got yourself dressed
Eating raw bacon it's okay, I was still impressed[split]I love you even if you don't
You've got your knife up to my throat
Why do you want to see me bleed?[split]Rooting through the garbage for treasures in the trash pile
Seeing my expression would always make you smile
Please don't touch my phone book, my friends are getting pissed off
Wake 'em in the morning and acting like a jerk off[split]I love you even if you don't
You've got your knife up to my throat
Why do you want to see me bleed?[split]I love you even if you don't
You've got your knife up to my throat
Why do you want to see me bleed?[split]I love you even if you don't
You've got your knife up to my throat
Why do you want to see me bleed?[split]Three men's all there were
three men out at sea
three men came aboard my ship
and took my true love from me
I couldn't believe
she wanted to leave
she wanted to leave[split]I've loved you so long
since you were a child
I've cared for your every need
I've tried to make you smile
when all the while
you wanted to leave
you wanted to leave[split]Go gather the guns
we'll blast them at sea
she begged for me not to shoot
for my true love is here with me,
and I've never loved thee,
and now I must leave,
and now I must leave.[split]So go fetch a bottle of rum dear friends
and fill up my glass to the rim
for I'm not the man, I used to be
now I'm one of them.[split]Most people are not okay
But they're taking their siestas in the sun
Got some ideas on the way it should be
But most of 'em just carrying on[split]Happy colored marbles that are rolling in my head
I put 'em back in the jacket of the one I love
Carry that velvet sack full of pretty colored marbles
And I'll ask you for 'em back, when I'm ready and done[split]Most people are not okay
And they're slackin' 'cause the job ain't done
Fillin' up on the poison nut
And getting down till the dawn[split]Happy colored marbles that are rolling in my head
I put 'em back in the jacket of the one I love
Carry that velvet sack full of pretty colored marbles
And I'll ask you for 'em back, when I'm ready and done[split]Pandy Fackler was a working girl
Living alone in another world
Of picket fences and a white fade
Sucking dicks under the Promenade[split]She was almost in a coma
From doing the Bossa Nova
And the Funky Cold Medina-man
I wish you coulda seen her[split]Poor little Pandy is doing the best she can
Eating cotton candy from the garbage can
First to come and the last to go
I met her backstage after the 2nd show[split]Two lonely people on a summer night
We weren't in love but it was still alright
I held her close and she squeezed me tight
My Pandy![split]I got nothing to lose
I saw the sun in May
I've got something to hold on to
I fell in love today[split]I saw the break at dawn
I saw a child in play
I saw the spring in the winter time
I fell in love today[split]I walk with the birds in flight
I fly with love today
Green grass never looked so good
I fell in love today[split]I feel like a million bucks
Nothing could break my sway
You people can't touch me
I fell in love today[split]I could build and aeroplane that travels over lands
I could take your DNA and replicate my hand
I could do so many things with my own bare hands[split]I'd love to be your ass chika, stick it up your ass
I'm gonna be your lawn mower and cut your fucking grass
I can do so many things with my own bare hands, fuck it[split]She gonna be my cock professor, studying my dick
She's gonna get a masters degree in fucking me
I can do so many things with my own bare hands[split]Take a shit on a bitch, shit fuck bubbajibba sucking on my shit
Kicking with a pussy gonna jammer, motherfucker, suck my fucking dick
I can do so many things with my own bare hands, fuck it[split]I can do so many things with my own bare hands
With my own bare hands, with my own bare hands
With my own bare hands[split]Ah, she danced like a floozie in a hot tub of guava
Achin' round the scene, you know she's hip to her mantra
He was a meditated fucker, all strung-out on Sinatra
Hitting Van Winkle like there ain't no tomorrow[split]I saw Van Winkle show up on the scene
I can't remember when I saw that's he's been doin' all the[split]Sketches of Winkle, crying to the heavens in a fit of rage
Sketches of Winkle, keep little humans locked up in a cage
Sketches of Winkle, I think I love her but she don't love me
Sketches of Winkle, why don't you love me, girl?[split]She drained all the fluid from the sink in the kitchen
Achin' 'round these all she's doin' is bitchin'
Steven said, "He went and bought a new pair of mittens
Mean Ween cut me and he said, "He was kiddin' "[split]I saw Van Winkle show up on the scene
I can't remember when I saw that's he's been doin' all the[split]Sketches of Winkle, cryin' to the Heavens in a fit of rage
Sketches of Winkle, keep little humans locked up in a cage
Sketches of Winkle, I think I love her but she don't love me
Sketches of Winkle, why don't you love me, girl?[split]Rip Van Winkle, rip, rip, rip, Van Winkle

From the golden shores of Kansas, to the middle of Japan
Reach around your soul and learn your fellow man[split]There are many colors in the homo rainbow
Don't be afraid to let your colors shine
Don't be ashamed of what God made you[split]It's a nine mile walk from the office to the pumps
Sometimes you think you're gonna drop
In the end you're filthy, dirty, horny and pissed off
And before you can leave you gotta sweep the fuckin' shop[split]It's a real real bitch to be workin' for the man
But shit, I do it well, so what the fuck
I could probably wash dishes at some other fuckin' dump
But it's all the same to me, bustin' ass to make a buck[split]So read 'em up and stick 'em, pump that fucker good
Some woman down on Main Street needs a jump
Get your fingers outta your ass and pump some faggot's gas
And think about how bad New Hope sucks[split]And it's a piss poor life when the ladies fire you up
And then you check their oil and know you're fucked
'Cause no one wants a loser who works for five an hour
Smells like gas, looks like shit, works in the rain and rude as hell[split]Now, I can fix a tire like Hurricane Melinda
I know, that I'm the best for what it's worth
So if I choose to help you don't look like you expect it
'Cause it's a gift that God gave me at birth[split]So read 'em up and stick 'em, pump that fucker good
Some woman down on Main Street needs a jump
Get your fingers outta your ass and pump some faggot's gas
And think about how bad New Hope sucks, woah[split]So read 'em up and stick 'em, pump that fucker good
Some woman down on Main Street needs a jump
Get your fingers outta your ass and pump some faggot's gas
And think about how bad New Hope sucks, woah[split]Floating like a ghost man

And go back to the quiet sound
Of Jim and Dan prancin' 'round the pool[split]You were the fool, and I feel sorry for you
You were the fool, but there's something you can do[split]You can wash your arm in a pool of mud
You can chop a tree, prevent a flood
You can speak with a turtle just by flippin' him around[split]You can build a boat and sail the sea
You can buy a moat and forge a key
Initiate the sequence, create catastrophe[split]I think about it turn around

Of Jim and Dan prancin' 'round the pool[split]You were the fool, and I feel sorry for you
You were the fool, but there's something you can do
You were the fool[split]I recall a time when we were lovers
Before you, I hadn't any other
When the bad times came along
I turned and you had gone
From the start, I loved you, I was wrong[split]Falling out, it's the end, may as well have never been
The cards are up, the chips are all cashed in
You won't see me again, don't consider me your friend
Falling out, look away, it's the end[split]Always thought of you as my big brother
Never knew we couldn't trust each other
Two faces I could see
As you shook my money tree
There's no more you and me, let it be[split]Falling out, It's the end and I lose another friend
The cards are up, the chips are all cashed in
You won't see me again, don't consider me your friend
Falling out, look away, it's the end[split]Falling out, It's the end, may as well have never been
The cards are up, the chips are all cashed in

You must not succumb.
I can feel you breathe. It's like a mega-weedge inside.
Please don't hide.[split]So mom, if you please, pass me the pork roll egg and cheese, if you please,
On a kaiser bun.
Mom, if you please, pass me the pork roll egg and cheese, if you please,

Wrapped up in a blanket and I'm feelin' wet
They said, "She flew from the goals in her life
Then she went like blood from a knife"
I'm here, and it's all so clear now[split]The wind flows and it's blowing cold and I'm still here
Gripping onto what's not around
Now it's all so clear to me now
Now I know, sometimes I try a bit too hard
And I can't let go of you[split]King Billy[split]King Billy, why don't you invite them up?
I've got a word or two to tell them
It's about the situation
A terrible miscommunication[split]Eating worms, oh, child of mine
Destined to side with the oppression
King Billy, let me speak to thee
[Incomprehensible] burn the connection
Oh man, fix the problem, it is the only solution[split]King Billy, I see them birds in flight
Take off in every direction
I'm a thinking man, a feeling man
I will not side with the oppression[split]King Billy[split]King Billy, why don't you invite them up?
Put 'em in the opposite direction
A chance at love attraction
A chance to heal the nation[split]King Billy, King Billy
King Billy, King Billy, King Billy[split]Good morning my love

The turquoise lake and starry skies
Mushroom clouds, flowing
Drift in pools of salt and brine[split]I feel a tick in my head and he's sucking on my head

And light a fire among his tribe
Carving from a bear's tooth

Fish were caught in the lowest tide
Thought of war kept him strong
He listened for the battle song, in the night[split]And the old would teach the young
To heed the word of the master's tongue
A chosen son would take a bride
And light the fire among his tribe, and on and on[split]How high can you fly?

To play you music
Now this song is called: "Mushroom Festival In Hell"[split]The wind is howling and the time is right for fear
In the emergence in the phosphorescent tears
And all the hippies gonna lick the mind of God?
They've already been immersed in the wad[split]The wind is howling and the sea is boiling down
The mind is the water, the mind is the water
'Cause it's a mushroom festival in hell
'Cause it's a mushroom festival in hell[split]Yeah, woo, woo, woo, woo[split]I'm flyin' (flyin')
In a frame of my mind that time cannot erase
I'm seein' (seein')
The future, the past as I lay the present to waste
I'm scopin' (scopin')
All these feelings I have and hopin' for them to come true
And I'm holdin' something more precious than fine ore, baby
I'm holdin' you[split]I'm breathin' (breathin')
The fumes of the grid that rid my lobe of oxygen
I'm climbin' (climbin')
The walls to where good and evil make amends
I'm trippin', writhin' and squealin', pukin'
Looking for someone like you
And i'm holdin' something more precious than fine ore, baby
I'm holdin' you[split]I'm flyin' (flyin')
In a frame of my mind that time cannot erase
I'm seein' (seein')
The future, the past as I lay the present to waste

All these feelings I have and hopin' for them to come true
And I'm holdin' something more precious than fine ore, baby
I'm holdin' you
And I'm holdin' something more precious than fine ore, baby
I'm holdin' you[split]Heard that you are new in town
Someone said you party down
Well, later I'll be comin' round
We'll rack 'em up and suck 'em down[split]Don't call your mother, don't call your priest
Don't call your doctor, call the police
You bring the razor blade, I'll bring the speed
Take off your coat, it's gonna be a long night[split]There'll be no second chance for you
Tomorrow you'll be black and blue
Show your friends your new tattoo
911 won't help you, fool[split]You're gonna suffer, you're gonna bleed
I've heard it all before, you will concede
I'm takin' everything, you're goin' down
Lock up the doors, it's gonna be a long night[split]It's gonna be a catfight
It's gonna be a gang-bang[split]Don't call your mother, don't call your priest

When I carbonate the test tube, then you won't see me
I've got a twin cab diesel combo, it takes me where I want to go
And all the nuphies are happy, they know of a fungus that grow
So when you see Hoecke's mind screw don't come running to me
Or I will scream and set aflame marble tulip juicy tree[split]Marble tulip juicy tree -- it's where I want to be
When I gnaw on the tulip it'll wish that it was me[split]Every morning I put my shoes on and I think about she
Who controls the four seasons inhaling kitties in the see
It's like a noodle in a salad -- little birdy wants to be set free-ee
I drill the corpse lobe with my mommy -- marble tulip juicy tree
So this song's about the loving thing that you are to me
Just stay away from my adenoids and marble tulip juicy tree[split]Marble tulip juicy tree -- it's where I want to be
When I gnaw on the tulip it'll wish that it was me[split]Doodley baboo

She's got your mind, body, and soul hitched
Shockadelica
You need a second opinion
But she never wears a stitch
So you can't take her home, she's got you tied with a golden rope
She won't let you play your guitar
And when you've cried enough
Maybe she'll let you up
For a nasty ride in her Shockadeli-car
Gonna make you beg[split]Gonna make you beg
Gonna make you spread your leg
Gonna want it, gonna get it

Didn't your mama tell you life is to good to waste?
Didn't she tell you that Lovesexy was the glam of them all?
If you can hang, you can trip on it
You surely won't fall
No side effects and the feeling last forever
Straight up - it tastes good
It makes you feel clever

I saw the governor and his lover holding hands
When I got to my place, I emptied my suitcase
And opened the windows wide[split]If you could save yourself, you'd save us all
Is that what you called me for
Is that why you're knocking on my door?
The time I've spent working myself to death[split]Thought that's what you wanted, I thought you needed my help
To make it good again, to make us strong
To make you happy, to push you along
And gain some respect, to be thrown a crumb
I was on my knees when you knocked me down[split]The wheels fell off, the bottom dropped out
The checks all bounced, I came in your mouth
Your mother came calling but there was no one around[split]The trash caught fire when the leaves turned brown

Don't seek the blood from the panther
Don't take a trip to you soon
I'm the one
Helding the time back from the sun
As I scope the lobe
I am the one who controls the sun
And I know that things will pass
As time elapses
Time elapsing through the sound of you;
And the things we could do
Just think of the master
Trying to fool the blastman
Check the cards at the table
Scream softly you are able
To see the sign of thine self as
Throughout the ages of time
Things u thought weren't going to
Climb the mountain
See the sun
Touch the waves of the earth
Feel the grass softly
And don't think for the one you know
I am - screaming backward in the sand[split](hey, dude, he's the stallion)[split]Mach 10 at sudden speed
Flying into the wind now
I'm flowing at my feet
Something of likeness to you now
I spotted you in the sun
I called your name from a distance
I knew you were the one
I called again
I do declare
I can float in the air
And with some love from above
Don't caress the weasel
And don't fall too soon
Don't seek the blood from the panther
Don't take a trip to you soon
I'm the one
Helding the time back from the sun
As I scope the lobe
I am the one who controls the sun
And I know that things will pass
As time elapses
Time elapsing through the sound of you;
And the things we could do
Just think of the master
Trying to fool the blastman
Check the cards at the table
Scream softly you are able
To see the sign of thine self as
Throughout the ages of time
Things u thought weren't going to
Climb the mountain
See the sun
Touch the waves of the earth
Feel the grass softly
And don't think for the one you know
I am - screaming backward in the sand[split](hey, dude, he's the stallion)[split]Drift away on a puffy cloud

Cloudy cloud cloudy cloud[split]I don't know you you are, I don't know who you want to be
When I carbonate the test tube, then you won't see me
I've got a twin cab diesel combo, it takes me where I want to go
And all the nuphies are happy, they know of a fungus that grow
So when you see Hoecke's mind screw don't come running to me
Or I will scream and set aflame marble tulip juicy tree[split]Marble tulip juicy tree -- it's where I want to be
When I gnaw on the tulip it'll wish that it was me[split]Every morning I put my shoes on and I think about she
Who controls the four seasons inhaling kitties in the see
It's like a noodle in a salad -- little birdy wants to be set free-ee
I drill the corpse lobe with my mommy -- marble tulip juicy tree
So this song's about the loving thing that you are to me
Just stay away from my adenoids and marble tulip juicy tree[split]Marble tulip juicy tree -- it's where I want to be
When I gnaw on the tulip it'll wish that it was me[split]Squelch the little weasel, crush him before he spawns
Break it to me gently, but with merriment and song
Squelch the little weasel, juice him as he bleeds
Feed him to the many, for thoust their souls shall weep[split]Sipping of the sunray blading in the earth
Evolving was the nectar given to the weasel birth
I was just a puppet until the clouds caved in
Bless me now you are sacred my flesh betwixt my skin[split]Sipping of the sunray blading in the earth
Evolving was the nectar given to the weasel birth[split]when u lie

Three men came aboard my ship and took my true love from me
I couldn't believe
She wanted to leave -- she wanted to leave[split]I've loved you so long, since you were a child
I've cared for your every need, I've tried to make you smile
When all the while
You wanted to leave -- you wanted to leave[split]Go gather the guns, we'll blast them at sea
She begged for me not to shoot
For "My true love is here with me,
And I've never loved thee,
And now I must leave, and now I must leave."[split]So go fetch a bottle of rum dear friends
And fill up my glass to the rim
For I'm not the man, I used to be

And you're so tired, and the reason is Camille-mille
Shockadelica
The girl must be a witch
She's got your mind, body, and soul hitched
Shockadelica
You need a second opinion
But she never wears a stitch
So you can't take her home, she's got you tied with a golden rope
She won't let you play your guitar
And when you've cried enough
Maybe she'll let you up
For a nasty ride in her Shockadeli-car
Gonna make you beg[split]Gonna make you beg
Gonna make you spread your leg
Gonna want it, gonna get it
And you'll never regret it[split]Talk to me lover, come on tell me what you taste
Didn't your mama tell you life is to good to waste?
Didn't she tell you that Lovesexy was the glam of them all?
If you can hang, you can trip on it
You surely won't fall
No side effects and the feeling last forever
Straight up - it tastes good
It makes you feel clever
You kiss your enemies like you know you should
Then you jerk your body like a horny pony would
You jerk your body like a horny pony would

Get your fingers outta your ass and pump some faggot's gas
And think about how bad New Hope sucks[split]And it's a piss poor life when the ladies fire you up
And then you check their oil and know you're fucked
'Cause no one wants a loser who works for five an hour
Smells like gas, looks like shit, works in the rain and rude as hell[split]Now, I can fix a tire like Hurricane Melinda
I know, that I'm the best for what it's worth
So if I choose to help you don't look like you expect it

Like a blizzard in Georgia or a train runnin' late
I call out your name girl in the heat of the night
And nobody answers 'cause somethin' ain't right[split]Breakfast at Shoney's at $2.99
Saved me some money and eased up my mind
I'm walkin' in circles and feelin' the pain
I'm tossin' and turnin' and cryin' in vain[split]Like a Japanese cowboy or a brother on skates
Like a blizzard in Georgia or a train runnin' late
I call out your name girl in the heat of the night
And nobody answers 'cause somethin' ain't right[split]Here we go[split]I'm ridin' at midnight and crossin' the line
From the rain in my windshield and the tears in my eyes
Now the bedroom is empty and I spent my last dime
And the lovers are leavin', I got nothin' but time,
I got you on my mind[split]Like a Japanese cowboy or a brother on skates
Like a blizzard in Georgia or a train runnin' late
I call out your name girl in the heat of the night
And nobody answers 'cause somethin' ain't right[split]The wash is out, it's hanging up
And all I have is nothing
Nothing to do, nothing to say
I think I must be dreaming[split]The sun comes up and I'm all washed out
Is this what Deaner was talking about?
I don't think I will ever return again my friend[split]If I was king, I'd wear a ring
And never hurt my people
I'd stay alert and dressed to kill
I might even slip you something[split]The sun comes up and I'm all washed out
Is this what Deaner was talking about?
I don't think I will ever return again my friend[split]The sun comes up and I'm all washed out

Penny takes Fluffy -- for a walk -- out on the path[split]Fluffy chases the other doggies -- on the path
The pig says to Penny get Fluffy back on the porch
So me and Fluffy and Penny are on the Porch[split]The wind is whispering and time is rolling by...
the the drip of the cork and heaven... (?)[split]Just a touch of the sunshine
to see you thru
add a pinch of the magic
to start anew
the wind is whispering
and time is rolling by
like the drip of the cork and heaven
we will ride the sky... ride the sky!
delving onward
we stop and face the sun
bleeding from the sphincter
like a convalescent nun
the wind is whispering
and time is rolling by
like the drip of the cork and heaven
we will ride the sky... ride the sky!!![split]Take me away to some other land, than'you

Floating like a baby
Swaying in a mother's arm
Sleeping like a baby[split]Fans stay all in light,
And friends day all in hide[split]For they talk him up, together
Together there's life flowing[split]Sending for the season
Flowers for the rapture
Shield her from the fire
Flowers for the sleeping[split]Fans stay all in light
And friends stay all in hide[split]For they don't get up, together
Together, there's life flowing[split]Soldier, child of honor

Together, there's life flowing.[split]We do not have the lyrics for Learnin’ to Love yet.[split]Prepare the mount, boy
Get ready to ride
On the steps of the stallion
Through the passage of life
With windows (rainbows?) flashing
It's a mighty long scene
And he kills the young one
With the steps of crime[split]One man! Controls the stallion
Two men! Can tame the stallion
Three men Can harness the stallion[split]Set off the flea bomb (blower)
With the light in the time
in the heavens of passageway
To the steps of the mind
And with all of the flashing?[split]And he tames the old one
And he tames the young one
Drink stallion, you are thirsty now
Stallion[split]Look there up above the hill, over the mountain
With lights from its holy lips and blood from the stallion
We talk of ancient scripts, its soul from the master
Sent to do no harm, far from - from disaster[split]I raised my hand up high, Boognish was looking onward
Said thy words shall now be done even move forward
Gazing at his spongy eye, I gasp in all it's glory
It's tongue was made by putting forth
the end of the story[split]Mach 10 at sudden speed
Flying into the wind now
I'm flowing at my feet
Something of likeness to you now
I spotted you in the sun
I called your name from a distance
I knew you were the one
I called again
I do declare
I can float in the air
And with some love from above
Don't caress the weasel
And don't fall too soon
Don't seek the blood from the panther
Don't take a trip to you soon
I'm the one
Helding the time back from the sun
As I scope the lobe
I am the one who controls the sun
And I know that things will pass
As time elapses
Time elapsing through the sound of you;
And the things we could do
Just think of the master
Trying to fool the blastman
Check the cards at the table
Scream softly you are able
To see the sign of thine self as
Throughout the ages of time
Things u thought weren't going to
Climb the mountain
See the sun
Touch the waves of the earth
Feel the grass softly
And don't think for the one you know
I am - screaming backward in the sand[split](hey, dude, he's the stallion)[split]For hither not, I am the stallion

(repeated 4-times)[split]Songwriters: Freeman, Aaron; Melchiondo, Michael[split]Hey there fancy pants play the songs that make us dance. 
Play the tunes that make the ladies swoon.
A  song for all the lonley hearts, shattered dreams, and broken parts.
It feels like sunny days are comin soon.[split]Hey Mr. Buttercup spin the wheel and try your luck.
The spot lights shinning bright tonight on you.
Bring along your lady friend, do a dance from way back when.
Tonights the night when all your dreams come true. [split](instermental)[split]Hey there sour grapes down in the dumps, long in the face. 
Chokin down your dinner all alone.
Feelin bad feelin blue tonight the rainbow ends with you.
So sit on down and make yourself at home.[split]So hey there fancy pants play the songs that make us dance.

A  song for all the lonley hearts, shattered dreams, and broken parts.
It feels like sunny days are comin soon.[split]Fancy pants, fancy pants, fancy pants, fancy pants.[split]I don’t know, maybe it was the rain,
Another gray day, of fault making.
The real test was finding a bucket with enough holes to let it out.
One of those days when the corn dries up,
And your nose turns red, and the crystals break.
Late day, the sun sets back up, 
Back up to the warm room.
God is lying on your bed talking backwards.
Here take my legs,
Take my eyes,
Take my brain, take my brain, take my brain, my brain.
Home, home without the window again, 
I got some blood on the floor,
The window won’t close, it’s getting cold
The weak marches flags with eyes of fire.
No, no not this again,
It’s like a stone that smokes instead of burns,
Like wet wood that’s green and fresh.
You want my chicken?!
...my potato salad?!
... you want to know how my day was?!
Well, God Was on My Bed When I Got Home!!!
... that's how my day was.[split](Instrumental)[split]Ahhhhh, shit, ahhh
Ahhhh bumblebee stung me
He stung my brain
Awwwww
He stung me, he stung me, uhh[split]Weedeating Vaughn's grass

It hurt, it hurt, oh god it hurt so badly[split]Ahhhh bumblebee stung me
Bumblebee stung me

Bumblebee stung me
Thank you[split]And when the sun it turns to snow
And the grass doesn't grow, don't laugh I love you
I could look outside my window every day
But you wouldn't be there to come out and play, don't laugh I love you[split]Ernest hemming way would always be there for me
But now earnest hemming way is dead now
If I could get you back someday
Don't you say you're going away, don't laugh I love you[split]And if you locked me in the sun
To the tinkle I would run, don't laugh I love you[split]I love you, I love you

And you're so tired, and the reason is Camille-mille
Shockadelica
The girl must be a witch
She's got your mind, body, and soul hitched
Shockadelica
You need a second opinion
But she never wears a stitch
So you can't take her home, she's got you tied with a golden rope
She won't let you play your guitar
And when you've cried enough
Maybe she'll let you up
For a nasty ride in her Shockadeli-car
Gonna make you beg[split]Gonna make you beg
Gonna make you spread your leg
Gonna want it, gonna get it
And you'll never regret it[split]Talk to me lover, come on tell me what you taste

You surely won't fall
No side effects and the feeling last forever

Look at yourself
Your lips are like two flaps of fat
They go front and back and flappity flap[split]I'm all staged
It's all an act
I'm really scared that I may fall back on the abstract
It'd be exactly where I'm at[split]If you're to be
The roaming eye
Pry it open and let me tell you why it sees
The harsh realities[split]Ocean man, take me by the hand

hola, my good friend

You killed my brother last winter
you shot him three times in the back
in the night i still hear mama weeping
oh mama, still dresses in black
I looked at every fiesta
for you i wanted to greet
maybe i'd sell you a chicken
with poison interlaced with the meat
You... you look like my brother
mama loved him the best
he was head honcho with the ladies
mama always said he was blessed
The village all gathered around him
they couldn't believe what they saw
i said it was you that had killed him
and that i'd find you and upstand the law
The people of the village believed me
mama... she wanted revenge
i told her i'd see that she was honored
i'd find you and put you to death
So now... now that i've found you
on this such a joyous day
i tell you it was me who killed him
but the truth i'll never have to say

Fortune smiled upon us, sacrifice the Argus
All that he might help us see[split]Magna eyes the track for miles, looking for disease
Puzzled by the mountains - tricked by the sea
and the Argus is practiced compassion
with an eye on you, as one is on me
will the god eye grant his forgiveness
and allow he that's lived, a reason to see[split]Counting days and building walls, bells ring so's to warn
All the signs that guide us, chosen by the Argus
Tell me has chosen you[split]Led by form we'll shed our soul
Trusting like a child
See the dark face that saved us
Drink from his empty eyes[split]and the Argus is practiced compassion
with an eye on you, as one is on me
will the god eye grant his forgiveness
letting droplets of light erupt from the sea...[split]Lying in beds of garlic and orchids, he closes an eye, which closes another
and in sleep he dreams, of watching and looking and feather clouds dancing
He curls up his lid and sleeps...[split]Swirling with visions on man's confusion
All of the work, done just to appease him
The Argus he cries, though love has it's place in the sun
It's only man's fear that carries him on...[split]When you've had your fun, and your work is done,
You must not succumb.

Please don't touch my phone book, my friends are getting pissed off
Wake 'em in the morning and acting like a jerk off[split]I love you even if you don't
You've got your knife up to my throat
Why do you want to see me bleed?[split]I love you even if you don't
You've got your knife up to my throat
Why do you want to see me bleed?[split]I love you even if you don't
You've got your knife up to my throat
Why do you want to see me bleed?[split]
